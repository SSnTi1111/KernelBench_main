          The memory access pattern for loads from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to   
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 1.5 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced loads and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 7.2 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          2.36 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 0.18 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps    
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons on the Warp  
          State Statistics and Source Counters sections.

          On average, each warp of this kernel spends 5.5 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on a 
          L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture) operation. Find the instruction producing the data being waited upon  
          to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the memory      
          access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by increasing    
          data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently used data to   
          shared memory. This stall type represents about 32.6% of the total average of 16.9 cycles between issuing     
          two instructions.

          On average, each warp of this kernel spends 5.4 cycles being stalled waiting for an immediate constant cache  
          (IMC) miss. A read from constant memory costs one memory read from device memory only on a cache miss;        
          otherwise, it just costs one read from the constant cache. Immediate constants are encoded into the SASS      
          instruction as 'c[bank][offset]'. Accesses to different addresses by threads within a warp are serialized,    
          thus the cost scales linearly with the number of unique addresses read by all threads within a warp. As       
          such, the constant cache is best when threads in the same warp access only a few distinct locations. If all   
          threads of a warp access the same location, then constant memory can be as fast as a register access. This    
          stall type represents about 31.9% of the total average of 16.9 cycles between issuing two instructions.       
    ----- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    INF   Check the Warp Stall Sampling (All Samples) table for the top stall locations in your source based on         
          sampling data. The Kernel Profiling Guide

          Instructions are executed in warps, which are groups of 32 threads. Optimal instruction throughput is         
          achieved if all 32 threads of a warp execute the same instruction. The chosen launch configuration, early     
          thread completion, and divergent flow control can significantly lower the number of active threads in a warp  
          per cycle. This kernel achieves an average of 24.2 threads being active per cycle. This is further reduced    
          to 22.6 threads per warp due to predication. The compiler may use predication to avoid an actual branch.      
          Instead, all instructions are scheduled, but a per-thread condition code or predicate controls which threads  
          execute the instructions. Try to avoid different execution paths within a warp when possible.

          different instructions. It executes 32-bit floating point (FADD, FMUL, FMAD, ...) and integer (IMUL, IMAD)    
          operations. It is well-utilized, but should not be a bottleneck.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.8 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          15.06 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.09 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps   
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently

          The memory access pattern for global stores in L1TEX might not be optimal. On average, this kernel accesses   
          4.0 bytes per thread per memory request; but the address pattern, possibly caused by the stride between       
          threads, results in 4.5 sectors per request, or 4.5*32 = 144.0 bytes of cache data transfers per request.     
          The optimal thread address pattern for 4.0 byte accesses would result in 4.0*32 = 128.0 bytes of cache data   
          transfers per request, to maximize L1TEX cache performance. Check the Source Counters section for             
          uncoalesced global stores.

          The memory access pattern for stores from L1TEX to L2 is not optimal. The granularity of an L1TEX request to  
          L2 is a 128 byte cache line. That is 4 consecutive 32-byte sectors per L2 request. However, this kernel only  
          accesses an average of 2.4 sectors out of the possible 4 sectors per cache line. Check the Source Counters    
          section for uncoalesced stores and try to minimize how many cache lines need to be accessed per memory        
          request.

          Every scheduler is capable of issuing one instruction per cycle, but for this kernel each scheduler only      
          issues an instruction every 2.7 cycles. This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to     
          less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of   
          14.89 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.24 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps   
          are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible   
          warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of      
          eligible warps, avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp.          
          Reducing stalls indicated on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections can help, too.

          On average, each warp of this kernel spends 25.1 cycles being stalled waiting for a scoreboard dependency on  
          a L1TEX (local, global, surface, texture) operation. Find the instruction producing the data being waited     
          upon to identify the culprit. To reduce the number of cycles waiting on L1TEX data accesses verify the        
          memory access patterns are optimal for the target architecture, attempt to increase cache hit rates by        
          increasing data locality (coalescing), or by changing the cache configuration. Consider moving frequently     
          used data to shared memory. This stall type represents about 61.6% of the total average of 40.8 cycles
